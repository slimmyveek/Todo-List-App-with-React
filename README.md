## Todo-List-App-with-ReactJs

### Introduction
This project implements the Front-End for a simple To-Do List web application, using the React JS library, and also Styled Components replacing pure CSS.
It includes the login page and the general UI of the app.
The login authentication logic and the tasks database for each user are not implemented, since this project aims to be a Front-End study only.
 
### Features
* User friendly interface for typing required tasks
* Add button for adding new task(s)
* Edit button for editing and update task(s)
* Delete button for deleting task(s).

### Obs.:
Currently, the 'checking or unchecking of task' functionalities which tells the completion of task are not implemented, since I considered focusing on CRUD operations to build this web app. Maybe I'll implement this later on.
